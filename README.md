# About The Project
This is a project developed at durhack, a hackathon hosted by Durham Universit. My idea for this hackathon is a weather predictor using time series forecasting. Predictions will be made using the Long Short-Term Memory model (LSTM) because it has been shown that it excels at predicting sequential data, weather data is sequential in nature. Weather data is sourced from Durham University's observatory under the Daily Climate Obervations (Dataset)[https://durhamweather.webspace.durham.ac.uk/open-access-climate-datasets/][[1]](#1).
